# There is a observation in 783. Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes.
###  Here **private Integer prev = null;** // that a need thing i learn in 
###  also is you want difference,  sorting somthing like that in tree questions so apply inorder traversal(asacding order arrangment) then it easy to operate them.

#  652. Find Duplicate Subtrees 
###  In this question's solution i find out a string based apporach which design a unique path for tree's left + right node,          then apply hashmap to count the particular path.
<prev>  String stringformed=currroot+"$"+left+"$"+right; <prev>
